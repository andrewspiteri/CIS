description: Build, validate, search, traverse, trace, and package the CIS repository graph. Use when locating components, contracts, references, symbols, callers, tests, dependencies, decisions, or bounded evidence before impact analysis, planning, implementation, or verification.

# CIS Graph and Context

1. Resolve the repository from `.cis/repository.yml`.
2. Run `cis graph validate --format agent`. If the graph is missing or stale, run `cis graph build --format agent`, then validate again.
3. Locate exact roots with `cis graph find` or `cis context search`; disambiguate with full IDs and kinds.
4. Use `cis graph related` or `cis graph trace` for evidence paths.
5. Use focused `cis context contract|symbol|references|callers|tests-for` queries or `cis context pack` for bounded source evidence.
6. Treat C# invocation arguments as privacy-safe shapes, and `dataflow` as intraprocedural call ordering only. Inspect canonical source before making semantic or runtime claims.
7. Report graph schema/build, freshness, compiler capabilities, diagnostics, truncation, roots, and omitted evidence.

Do not edit `.cis/local/`, imply complete semantic coverage, include proposed edges silently, or replace canonical Markdown with graph output.
